        Within mechanically signal led areas, Network Rail’s signallers
        communicate with each other using bell codes. Bell codes enable
        signallers to communicate information regarding the type of train being
        offered, the status of trains within sections of the track or emergency
        information.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-6">
        The process works by the signaller at one signal box tapping the
        corresponding message code on a switch, to communicate a message to the
        signaller in the next box further up the train line.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-6">
        This causes a bell to ring on the recipient’s box in the same pattern
        entered by the sender. For example, the code for “Train approaching” is
        “1-2-1”, translating to a single ring, followed by a pause (the hyphen),
        then two rings, then another pause, followed by another single ring. A
        bell code is acknowledged as being understood by the receiver repeating
        the code from their signal box to confirm receipt of the message.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-6">
        There are 51 permutations of bell codes and corresponding messages for
        signallers to memorise – of which can be a very challenging, daunting
        and a difficult task to remember, especially when required in emergency
        scenarios. These codes can be clustered into groups such as
        “Classification of Trains”, “Information, Requests & Emergencies” and
        “No Call Attention Required”.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-6">
        Currently, the signallers are required to learn all 51 codes from a
        textbook, which has proven to be challenging and difficult to memorise
        their meanings and specific bell code structure due to the vast number
        of codes. Network Rail were looking to build a digital solution to
        mitigate these learning difficulties, and ensure the signallers are able
        to produce all of the codes from memory - especially in emergency
        situations.
