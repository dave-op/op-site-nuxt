        Our Solution

          We worked alongside the stakeholders at Network Rail to develop a
          digital solution that would enable the signaller engineers to learn
          the 51 mission-critical bell codes in a much more efficient, engaging
          and dynamic way than previously experienced, by building a bespoke iOS
          and Android mobile app.

        <div class="mb-6">
          We started by completing a discovery phase in order to fully
          understand the process by which the signal engineers communicate with
          each other across the track. We developed an information architecture
          (IA) diagram alongside Network Rail, to help us conceptualize and
          design the app’s user journey, and develop the most efficient way for
          their signallers to interact with the content.

        <div>
          After several exploration sessions with the subject matter expert
          (SME), we established that not everyone learns the same way. With this
          in mind, we developed the bell code content interface to be capable of
          switching between two separate views, one detailing a list of the bell
          codes, and one displaying the codes via a card-based format. Through
          each interface, the audio track for the bell code could be played on
          demand, enabling the signallers to select their most desired way to
          learn and absorb the multitude of codes.

      <div class="md:text-2xl font-medium font-kumbh">
        <div class="mb-6">
          We designed an intuitive user interface across the app, that was
          consistent with the Network Rail brand guidelines, coupled with a
          modern app twist, with interactions based on the Google Material UI.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-6">
          We storyboarded, designed and developed 4 mini-games specifically to
          assist signallers in learning the codes. The games consisted of “Fill
          in the blank”, “Ring the bell”, “Join the dots” and “Code matcher”.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-6">
          In order to track the efficacy of the app, we developed a “Bell IQ”
          system that consists of an algorithm to calculate the cumulative
          scores of all of the mini-games and present the signaller with a “Bell
          IQ” percentage. The Bell IQ system is designed to motivate signallers
          to learn all of the codes accurately, and the signaller must complete
          all 4 mini-games with 100% accuracy to achieve a Bell IQ of 100%.
        </div>
        <div>
          We completed a series of usability tests to ensure that the user
          interface that we had designed did in fact function as expected during
          real-life usage.

        Outcome
      </div>
      <div class="md:text-2xl font-medium font-kumbh">
        <div>
          The app proved a great success with the Network Rail signallers, and
          improved the speed of knowledge retention by 87%. The ease of access
          to the content through the on-demand format on their mobile devices,
          enabled signallars to gain instant access to the bell codes, enabling
          them to engage with the content and learn the codes wherever they are,
          24/7.
